# ADM-HW1

## Structure of repo:
In hw1scripts folder you can find python files for each of the subtitles of homework. Firstaful,i saved my codes into txt files. But i realized that i have to save them into py file.So that i copy my codes from txt to py files. Because of this reason some of the codes just shifted little bit. I checked them to be true ,but in the case there are still shifted codes, i also uploaded the txt files into hw1scriptstxt folder.

Python files constructed below format:

#1Name of the exercise

codes

#2Name of the exercise

codes
